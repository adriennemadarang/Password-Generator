# Password-Generator

Welcome! This website contains a password generator which can create a randomized password ranging anywhere from 8 to 128 characters. You are also able to choose whether you want to include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters or all of them! This is not meant to be cryptographically secure, just merely for fun with JavaScript. 

## How to Run
You can either download the file and open the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages. I have also provided a direct link to the site below.
